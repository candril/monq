# Selection and Deletion

**Status**: In Progress

## Description

Visual selection mode for bulk operations on documents. Supports selecting individual rows, ranges, and all documents. Deletion requires explicit selection first — no way to delete without selecting.

## What's Done

- `v` enters selection mode; `Escape` exits
- `j`/`k` moves and extends selection in selection mode
- `Space` toggles individual row selection
- `o` jumps to the other end of the selection range
- `Ctrl+A` selects all documents matching current filter
- `Shift+D` triggers deletion with `ConfirmDialog` (shows count + first 5 doc previews)
- Visual indicator: selected rows shown with blue `theme.selection` background
- Selection count shown in header: "SELECT N" / "selected N"
- After deletion: documents reloaded, selection mode exited

## What's Missing

- `y` to duplicate selected documents (insert copies with new `_id`) — currently `y` is clipboard yank (see spec 014)
- `APPEND_DOCUMENTS` state action exists but is unused — no incremental loading

## Capabilities

### P1 - Must Have

- `v` enters selection mode
- `j`/`k` extends selection up/down in selection mode
- `Ctrl+A` selects all documents (matching current filter)
- `Escape` exits selection mode
- `Shift+D` deletes selected documents
- Confirmation dialog before deletion:
  - Shows count of rows being deleted
  - Preview of first 5 documents to be deleted
  - Requires explicit confirmation

### P2 - Should Have

- `y` duplicates selected documents (insert with new `_id`) — **not yet implemented**
- Visual indicator showing selected rows (different background color) — **done**
- Selection count in header — **done**

## Design Notes

- Nothing can be deleted without first entering selection mode
- Confirmation dialog is mandatory — no `--force` or skip
- After deletion, reload documents and exit selection mode
- Selection state lives in `AppState`: `selectionMode`, `selectionStart`, `selectedRows: Set<number>`, `frozenSelection`
